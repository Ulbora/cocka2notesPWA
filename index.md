WebAssembly, although experimental now, will be the way mobile applications are built in the future. Although you can write WebAssembly code in many languages, I chose Golang for this application. WebAssembly allows you to eliminate most of the JavaScript needed with most SPA's.

WebAssemby can be a complete replacement for JavaScript Frameworks like Angular and React. By eliminating the JavaScript, you can build a faster application. Instead of writing JavaScript, you can build a WebAssembly app in your language of choice.
